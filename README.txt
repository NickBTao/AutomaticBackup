DESCRIPTION

The program copies and encrypts a source drive and folder to a target (backup) drive and folder.



NOTA BENE:
- Works as is for my personal use. However, would need amendments in a professional context.


FEATURES

- Encryption key is unique for each folder and depends of the folder name and hardcoded key
- Color coded text informs user of what the program is doing and potential errors or issues
